From getting my tools set up, to teaching the class about the importace of lists in JavaScript & Python, CSP Trimester 1 has really taught me a lot about a potential future for me in CS."

    "## Key Points from Sprints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools Setup\n",
    "- Through this sprint, I understood the basics of Computer Science, and made sense of the basic tools and programs that would be used in the course\n",
    "- Despite positive expectations, the setup of tools on their own was quite difficult, and took much longer than expected\n",
    "- While the effects were not immidiate, this setup helped me troubleshoot technical issues that cropped out throughout the trimester\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lessons in basics of Python & Javascript\n",
    "- Through this sprint, I made sense of the basics of the coding languages through the student led lessons\n",
    "- The homework provided throughout the lessons helped incorporate a better understanding to assist in a better learning of the concepts\n",
    "- By also teaching a lesson, I was able to undestand both sides of the coin well, with experience as a teacher also assiting with the learning of the topic\n",
    "\n",
    "### N@TM Project\n",
    "- Through the project, more than technical skills, technical collaboration was an important takeaway for me\n",
    "- By working with many people to create a project worthy of display to an audience, I used valuable skills in managing time and dividing tasks to create a better project\n",
    "- By presenting the project to people with technical backgrounds, it was valuable to recieve valuble insight and comments on our work, and how we could improve\n",
    "- Through the feedback that we receieved, such as question on how the UI worked, and what code we used, we recieved a greater understanding in our own project by answering such questions that otherwise would have not been recognized"

    "After learning much of the basics this trimester, next trimester, I hope to work on something that could help students further.  Once thing I had in mind was to create a database of templates that can be used to help create better projects for students.  Some templates could include blog templates for purposes that are required students, and lessons & hw templates.  One issue I ran into this trimester involved the incostinecy between lessons and homeworks, as some lessons were overly complicated and detailed for the material, while some were so sparsely detailed that comleting the homeworks with the given information was a challange.  By giving a universal template, a greater uniformity can be achieved between homeworks and lessons, resulting in greater understand for the teachers and students. "

    "Through this trimester, through the countless commits and code fixes I have done, much has been completed and worked on to come to this point.  Many of the commits are quite small, containing small changes.  This occured because when I was attempting to submit the homeworks, I ran into multiple issues, resulting in the commit-happy fervor.  In the end, it was CSA student Xavier Thompson who helped me fix everything."
